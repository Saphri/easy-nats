/**
 * Placeholder model for testing unsupported type validation.
 *
 * This model is referenced in test code to verify that the library
 * properly validates and rejects types that cannot be serialized/deserialized.
 *
 * Note: In practice, unsupported types (primitives, arrays) cannot be used directly
 * as generic type parameters in Java, so this class serves as documentation
 * of what the validation should prevent.
 *
 * Jackson can actually deserialize primitive wrapper types (Integer, Long, etc.),
 * but the library validates against unsupported patterns before delegating to Jackson.
