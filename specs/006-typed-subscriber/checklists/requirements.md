# Specification Quality Checklist: Typed Subscriber with @NatsSubscriber Annotation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- **Built on 004-nats-subscriber-mvp**: This feature extends the basic subscriber infrastructure with typed message support and CloudEvents handling. Core annotation discovery, bean wiring, and implicit ack/nak are inherited from 004.
- **MVP Scope**: Adds typed deserialization and CloudEvents unwrapping. ConsumerContext (manual ack/nak control) is deferred to a future MVP.
- **Critical Constraints**:
  - All messages MUST be CloudEvent 1.0 wrapped (no raw JSON support)
  - Subscriber methods have exactly 1 parameter (the deserialized data type)
  - No ConsumerContext/manual ack support in this slice
- **New in this feature**:
  - CloudEvents data field extraction and JSON deserialization
  - Support for typed parameters (POJO, records, generics)
  - Build-time type validation (Jackson-deserializable)
  - Non-CloudEvents message rejection
- **Status**: All checklist items now passing. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.
