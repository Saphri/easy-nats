# Specification Quality Checklist: Typed Serialization with Jackson Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [Typed Serialization Spec](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain in core requirements
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Final Updates**: Spec simplified to Jackson-only model from user perspective:
- **TypedPayloadEncoder**: Reduced to Jackson serialization only (no native encoding for primitives/arrays)
- **Type Support**: Only Jackson-compatible types (POJOs, records, annotated classes). Primitives and arrays are NOT supported—users must wrap them.
- **ObjectMapper**: Only default CDI-injected ObjectMapper supported. No custom mapper configuration. Users work with types, not mapper configuration.
- **Carrier Format**: CloudEvents binary-mode is internal implementation detail—users don't see or interact with it
- **Validation**: Type introspection at registration (via `ObjectMapper.getTypeFactory().constructType()`), clear errors at runtime for serialization/deserialization failures
- **User-Facing Surface**: Users declare type and publish/subscribe. Library handles serialization, deserialization, and transport wrapping internally.

**Simplifications**:
- Removed all mention of alternative encodings, native handling, or special cases
- Clear rule: "If Jackson can serialize/deserialize it, it works; if not, wrap it"
- No polymorphic type clarification needed (treated as unsupported unless custom deserializer is provided)

**Validation Result**: ✅ **SPEC READY FOR NEXT PHASE**

All mandatory items pass. The specification provides:
- Clear, simple value proposition: typed messages without manual JSON/CloudEvents handling
- Explicit type boundaries: Jackson-compatible types supported; others must be wrapped
- Testable requirements (8 functional requirements, 6 measurable success criteria)
- Independent user stories (P1 features are independently valuable)
- User-focused acceptance scenarios with clear error guidance
- Assumptions clarifying CloudEvents carrier format and Jackson-only approach
- Alignment with planned `TypedPayloadEncoder` simplification
