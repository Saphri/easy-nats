# Data Model: Dev Services Processor for NATS

**Date**: 2025-11-01
**Feature**: Dev Services Processor for NATS

## Entities

This feature does not introduce any new persistent data entities. Its primary role is to manage the lifecycle of a transient NATS container for development and testing purposes and to provide its configuration to the application.

The only "data" involved are the configuration properties, which are defined in the feature specification and the implementation plan.
