# Feature Specification: NATS Connection Access API

**Feature Branch**: `010-nats-connection-access`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "as a developer I want easy and safe access to a connection to nats for any advanced use"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Access Raw NATS Connection for Advanced Operations (Priority: P1)

A developer using the Quarkus EasyNATS extension needs direct access to the underlying NATS connection to perform advanced operations not covered by the extension's higher-level APIs. Examples include creating custom subscriptions, managing push subscriptions, or accessing NATS metadata.

**Why this priority**: This is the core requirement that enables power users and advanced use cases. Without it, developers are blocked from using NATS features beyond what the extension provides. This is the minimum viable feature that delivers direct value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that a developer can obtain a NATS connection object, establish a subscription, and receive messages through it independently of the extension's publisher/subscriber annotations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Quarkus application with the EasyNATS extension enabled, **When** a developer injects or accesses a NATS connection, **Then** they receive a valid, open connection to the NATS server that can be used for any NATS operations.
2. **Given** an active NATS connection obtained from the extension, **When** the developer uses it to publish a message to a subject, **Then** the message is successfully delivered to all subscribers.
3. **Given** an active NATS connection obtained from the extension, **When** the developer creates a subscription and publishes a message, **Then** the subscription receives the message without delay.

### User Story 2 - Thread-Safe Connection Access (Priority: P1)

A developer working in a multi-threaded Quarkus application needs to safely access the NATS connection from multiple threads without race conditions or connection corruption.

**Why this priority**: Thread safety is critical for production applications. If the connection is not thread-safe, developers will encounter hard-to-debug concurrency issues that break in production. This is equally critical as basic access.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that multiple concurrent threads can safely publish messages through the same connection and receive them correctly, with no connection errors or lost messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple threads accessing the same NATS connection simultaneously, **When** each thread publishes a message concurrently, **Then** all messages are delivered successfully without connection errors.
2. **Given** a connection being used by one thread for publishing while another thread subscribes, **When** both operations occur concurrently, **Then** the subscriber receives all published messages correctly.

---

### User Story 3 - Safe Connection Lifecycle Management (Priority: P2)

A developer needs confidence that the NATS connection is properly managed - it won't be prematurely closed while they're using it, and it will be cleaned up appropriately when the application shuts down.

**Why this priority**: This prevents resource leaks and connection errors. It's less critical than basic access and thread-safety, but essential for production stability. Without it, developers must manually manage connection lifecycle, introducing error-prone code.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that the connection remains open during application runtime, and verifying that it is properly closed when the application shuts down without leaving zombie connections.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an application with an active NATS connection, **When** the connection is obtained for use, **Then** the connection remains open and usable until the application explicitly stops.
2. **Given** an application that has obtained a NATS connection, **When** the application shuts down, **Then** the connection is gracefully closed without leaving orphaned resources.

---

### User Story 4 - Multiple Connection Access Patterns (Priority: P2)

A developer may need different ways to access the connection - via dependency injection, static accessor methods, or programmatic lookup - depending on their code structure and use case.

**Why this priority**: Flexibility in access patterns is important for developer experience but secondary to basic functionality. Different developers have different coding patterns (e.g., some use DI, others prefer static helpers in older codebases).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that a developer can obtain a NATS connection through at least two different access patterns (e.g., injection and static method) and both methods return the same, usable connection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer using dependency injection patterns, **When** they inject a NATS connection, **Then** they receive an active connection.
2. **Given** a developer who prefers static accessor methods, **When** they call a static utility to get the connection, **Then** they receive the same active connection that would be injected.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a developer tries to access the connection before the application is fully initialized?
- How does the extension handle connection failures or reconnections while a developer is using the connection?
- What mechanisms prevent a developer from accidentally closing the connection and breaking other subscriptions/publishers?
- How does the feature handle multiple Quarkus applications running in the same JVM process?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Extension MUST provide a way for developers to obtain a reference to the active NATS connection
- **FR-002**: The connection provided MUST be the same underlying NATS connection used by the extension's publisher and subscriber mechanisms
- **FR-003**: The connection MUST be thread-safe for concurrent use by multiple threads
- **FR-004**: Accessing the connection MUST be simple and not require low-level NATS API knowledge
- **FR-005**: The connection MUST remain valid and usable for the entire application lifetime
- **FR-006**: Connection access MUST work within the Quarkus application context (respecting CDI lifecycle)
- **FR-007**: The extension MUST prevent developers from closing the connection, since the connection is shared by all application publishers and subscribers
- **FR-008**: The connection provided to developers MUST NOT expose a `close()` method or equivalent that could terminate the shared connection
- **FR-009**: If a developer attempts to call `close()` on the provided connection, the extension MUST prevent the operation and provide a clear error message explaining that closing is not permitted
- **FR-010**: Developers MUST receive clear error messages if they attempt to use a closed connection (in case the connection is closed by the extension due to connection failures)
- **FR-011**: Extension MUST provide documentation showing common advanced use cases (custom subscriptions, push subscriptions, metadata access) and explicitly warn against attempting to close the connection

### Key Entities

- **NATS Connection**: The underlying `io.nats.client.Connection` object from the NATS client library, representing an open connection to the NATS server.
- **Connection Manager**: The extension component responsible for managing the connection lifecycle, ensuring it's properly initialized, maintained, and cleaned up.
- **Access Point**: The mechanism (injection point, static method, or other) through which developers can obtain the connection.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can obtain a NATS connection and successfully execute any NATS client operation within 30 seconds of reading the documentation.
- **SC-002**: Connection access works reliably in multi-threaded scenarios with zero message loss or connection corruption under concurrent load.
- **SC-003**: 95% of developers attempting to use advanced NATS operations report that the API is intuitive and required minimal trial-and-error.
- **SC-004**: Zero connection-related resource leaks detected in applications using the access API over extended runtime periods.
- **SC-005**: Connection operations complete with minimal latency overhead (no more than 5% additional latency compared to direct NATS client access).

## Assumptions

1. **NATS client thread safety**: We assume the underlying `io.nats:jnats` library is thread-safe for the connection object, as documented in the NATS Java client.
2. **Single NATS connection per application**: We assume a typical Quarkus application uses a single NATS connection. Multiple connections per application are not explicitly supported in this feature.
3. **Shared connection is critical**: The connection is a shared resource used by all application publishers and subscribers. Closing it would break all NATS communication in the application. Therefore, developers must not be able to close the connection.
4. **Quarkus dependency available**: We assume Quarkus and Arc (CDI) are available and properly configured in the runtime module.
5. **Basic NATS knowledge**: We assume developers accessing the raw connection have basic familiarity with the NATS client API, even though we'll provide examples.

## Out of Scope

- **Connection pooling or multiple connections**: This feature provides access to a single application-level connection.
- **Custom NATS server configuration**: We assume the NATS server is already configured and accessible; this feature doesn't configure NATS itself.
- **Advanced NATS features beyond access**: Features like custom authentication, TLS configuration, or connection retry policies are out of scope (handled by existing Quarkus NATS configuration).
