# Specification Quality Checklist: Typed NatsPublisher with CloudEvents Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

âœ… **Specification Ready for Planning**

All quality checks passed. The specification is:
- **Simplified scope**: 2 user stories (P1 typed JSON, P2 CloudEvents)
- **No @NatsSubject**: Subject configuration deferred to future MVP
- **No backward compatibility requirement**: Fresh typed publisher implementation
- **Simple testing**: Manual docker-compose + NATS CLI (no automated integration tests)
- Defines 10 functional requirements and 6 success criteria
- Documents encoder/decoder resolution order (primitives first, then Jackson)
- Emphasizes @RegisterForReflection requirement for native image support
- Documents all assumptions and planning notes
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are unambiguous and testable

The feature is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.
