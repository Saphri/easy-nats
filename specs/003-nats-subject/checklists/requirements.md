# Specification Quality Checklist: @NatsSubject Annotation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarifications Addressed

✓ **Annotation Configuration Pattern**: Specification updated to reflect the correct pattern: @NatsSubject is a configuration annotation with a String value parameter applied to NatsPublisher fields. Example: `@NatsSubject("orders") NatsPublisher<Order> orderPublisher;`

✓ **Annotation is on NatsPublisher Fields Only**: @NatsSubject can ONLY be applied to NatsPublisher field types. Applying it to other types will raise an error.

✓ **Multiple Publishers Support**: Multiple NatsPublisher fields can exist in the same class, each with its own @NatsSubject annotation specifying different subjects.

✓ **Mandatory on All NatsPublisher Fields**: Every NatsPublisher field MUST have the @NatsSubject annotation. Fields without it will fail with a clear error.

✓ **String Value Parameter Required**: @NatsSubject requires a non-empty String value parameter. Empty strings will be rejected.

## Notes

All checklist items passed. Clarifications have been incorporated. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.
