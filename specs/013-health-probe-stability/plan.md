# Implementation Plan: Health Probe Stability

**Branch**: `013-health-probe-stability` | **Date**: 2025-10-31 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/013-health-probe-stability/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The primary requirement is to ensure the startup health probe, once it reports an "UP" status, maintains that status indefinitely. This prevents container orchestrators like Kubernetes from prematurely restarting the application due to transient failures that might occur after a successful startup. The technical approach will involve implementing a stateful health check that "latches" in the "UP" state.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Java 21
**Primary Dependencies**: Quarkus 3.27.0, SmallRye Health, NATS JetStream client (jnats 2.23.0)
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: JUnit 5, Maven Surefire (unit tests), Maven Failsafe (integration tests)
**Target Platform**: Linux server (containerized environments)
**Project Type**: Multi-module Maven project (Quarkus Extension)
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: The startup probe's status must not change from "UP" to "DOWN".
**Scale/Scope**: Affects the health check endpoint for the NATS connection.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **VII. Observability First**: This feature directly enhances the health monitoring aspect of the extension, aligning with the principle of providing robust observability. The startup probe's stability is critical for reliable operation in Kubernetes and other containerized environments.

The proposed changes are fully compliant with the project constitution.

```

### Source Code (repository root)
The project follows the standard multi-module Maven structure for Quarkus extensions.

```text
├── runtime/                # Extension runtime JAR (deployed to users)
│   └── src/main/java/io/jefrajames/easynats/runtime/health/
│       └── NatsConnectionHealthCheck.java # Existing health check to be modified
├── deployment/             # Build-time processor
└── integration-tests/      # E2E tests validating extension in Quarkus app
```

**Structure Decision**: The existing project structure will be used. The primary change will be within the `runtime` module, specifically modifying the existing `NatsConnectionHealthCheck`.

## Complexity Tracking

No violations of the constitution are anticipated.
