# Implementation Plan: NATS Health Check Endpoints

**Branch**: `011-nats-health-endpoints` | **Date**: 2025-10-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/011-nats-health-endpoints/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature introduces standard health check endpoints (liveness, readiness, and startup) to expose the status of the NATS connection. This will be implemented using the Quarkus SmallRye Health extension, providing a `HealthCheck` implementation that monitors the NATS connection status via a `ConnectionListener`.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Java 21
**Primary Dependencies**: Quarkus 3.27.0, NATS JetStream client, SmallRye Health
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Test-Driven Development (TDD): Unit tests (runtime) and Integration tests (integration-tests)
**Target Platform**: Quarkus applications (native or JVM)
**Project Type**: Quarkus Extension
**Performance Goals**: Health check endpoints should respond within 100ms.
**Constraints**: The implementation must not introduce blocking operations on critical paths.
**Scale/Scope**: The health checks should support any number of concurrent requests without significant performance degradation.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| I. Extension-First Architecture | ✅ Pass | The health check will be implemented as part of the existing Quarkus extension. |
| II. Minimal Runtime Dependencies | ✅ Pass | SmallRye Health is a standard Quarkus dependency, so no new external dependencies are added. |
| III. Test-Driven Development | ✅ Pass | TDD will be followed for both unit and integration tests. |
| IV. Java 21 Compatibility | ✅ Pass | All new code will be Java 21 compatible. |
| V. CloudEvents Compliance | ✅ Pass | This feature does not directly interact with CloudEvents. |
| VI. Developer Experience First | ✅ Pass | The health checks will be automatically enabled, requiring no developer configuration. |
| VII. Observability First | ✅ Pass | This feature directly implements a core part of the observability principle. |
