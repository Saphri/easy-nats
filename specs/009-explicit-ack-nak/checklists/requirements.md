# Specification Quality Checklist: Explicit Ack/Nak Control

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [Explicit Ack/Nak Control](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Clarification Resolved** (2025-10-28):
- Edge case: "What happens if a subscriber method neither acknowledges nor negative acknowledges before the method returns?"
  - Resolution: The framework does nothing; message handling behavior is determined by NATS JetStream's configured AckPolicy and timeout settings.
  - Rationale: Let NATS handle the default behavior rather than adding framework-level timeout logic.

**Status**: âœ… All quality checks passed. Specification is ready for planning phase.
